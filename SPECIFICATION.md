# Chrome proportional tab switching

This chrome extension will provide the following feature:

It will override the Ctrl + Num keybinds. If there are more than 15 active
tabs, instead of switching to the tab with the specified Number, it should
switch to the Num * n/10 th tab, where n is the amount of tabs open.
